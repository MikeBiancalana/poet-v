INTRODUCTION                                                      *poet-v* *poetv*

Poet-v is a vim/nvim plugin that detects and activates virtual environments in
your python <poetry>(https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) or
<pipenv>(https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) project.

It is inspired (and closely resembles) both
<vim-virtualenv>(https://github.com/jmcantrell/vim-virtualenv) and its pipenv
spin-off <vim-pipenv>(https://github.com/PieterjanMontens/vim-pipenv). However
it also adds the ability to interact with virtual environments created by
poetry.
